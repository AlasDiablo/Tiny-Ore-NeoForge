## About Dio's Tiny Ore

Dio's Tiny Ore is an ore generation mod focused on adding ore to enhance exploration.

## Getting Started

Dio's Tiny Ore adds a variant of all vanilla ore that drops between two and six nuggets (Non-vanilla nugget added
by [Dio's Extended Resources](https://github.com/AlasDiablo/Extended-Resources-NeoForge)).

You can find a small quantity of those in every biome between height -64 and 127.

### To enhance exploration, we increase ore generation in some biome:

#### Tiny Coal Ore

You can find more tiny coal ore in Desert and Savanna biomes between height -12 and 127,
This is also compatible with mods that implement the `is_desert` and `is_savanna` tags in their biomes.
